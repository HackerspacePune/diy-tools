      In this video I'm going to show you how to make nickel-chromium electric fret-saw or a so 
      called cutter. With the help of a hand made electric fret-saw you will be able to saw out,
      burn out beautiful frames, wooden jewel-boxes, which you may present to someone. You will 
      also be able to cut plastic, foam plastic etc. evenly with the help of a hand made fret-saw.
      To manufacture a cutter with your own hands we need:
      Power supply 12V 5-10А from PC or another device
      Nickel-chromium wire with the section of 0,4 – 0,8 mm.
      Wooden handles or 2 pieces of a branch
      2 nails or 2 lengths of a firm wire
      Hand made electric fret-saw is very easy to manufacture and to work with! I hope that some 
      of you will make the one for himself and remember me well...
